                        When looking into how discrimination affects the LGBTQIA+ community I looked into this sup-topic due to all the thing surrounding it such as violence against people that are trans, problems with health care and the laws that goes against their identity, their human rights & their ablity to have access to a safe space when it comes to health related things.</p>

    					about a sixth of the Lgbtqia community faces 		discrimination in health care settings & that a fifth avoid being in health care settings and seeking medical care as a whole due to the fear os discrimination.

                        Though The Afordable Care Act was set in place to protect the community from discrimination, harrasment & mistreatment as stated from 
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/url?	sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjUq-CC1p_7AhVHkYkEHfkQAwEQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanprogress.org%2Farticle%2Fdiscrimination-prevents-lgbtq-people-accessing-health-care%2F&usg=AOvVaw2mB2B4_7DMpJZmLkx0Yy40"> American Progress</a> 
                        but while Trump was in office, he a change to make it easier for health care providers to discriminate against the lgtqia+ community which adds on to the reasoning behind the avoidance of health care enviorments.

                        With discrimination it puts our lives in danger, there has been plenty examples of that, from the
                            <a href="https://www.google.com/url?	sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjUq-CC1p_7AhVHkYkEHfkQAwEQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanprogress.org%2Farticle%2Fdiscrimination-prevents-lgbtq-people-accessing-health-care%2F&usg=AOvVaw2mB2B4_7DMpJZmLkx0Yy40"> American Progress</a> 
                            There has been examples of misconduct and discrimination in these enviorments, once a patient with HIV told them that he was involved with antoher man sexually and after that the staff at the hospital refused to give him the medications he needed for the HIV.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Going back to what I said before of the violence and danger towards people who are trans, there has also been examples of discimination towards them in health care enviorments, for instance; a teen that is trangender was placed in the hospital due to suicidal ideation and self-inflicted injuries, he was constantly misgendered & discharged early by the staff. Unfortunately he commitmitted suicide.
